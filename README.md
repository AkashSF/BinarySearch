# Binary Search
## Aim
    To perform the operation of binary search on an array.
## Theory or Basic Algorithm
    ->To perform this search, data must be in sorted form.
    ->It works by comparing the element with the middle most element of the collection.
    ->If the item is greater than the middle item, search will continue in the right sub-array, otherwise in the left sub-array.
    ->This division continues until the element is found.
